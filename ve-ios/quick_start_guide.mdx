Welcome to the Banuba Video Editor SDK for iOS! Follow these steps to integrate the SDK into your app in just 5 minutes.


### System Requirements
- **iOS**: 15.0 or later
- **Xcode**: 16.0 or later
- **Swift**: 5.9 or later
- **CocoaPods**: 1.10.0 or later


### Step 1: Get the License Token
Test all SDK features free for 14 days. [Contact us](https://47214837.hs-sites.com/contact) for a trial token or with any questions.

### Step 2: Download the Example Repository
Clone the sample repository from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Banuba/ve-sdk-ios-integration-sample.git
```


### Step 3: Install the SDK
We recommend using CocoaPods for a quick setup.

1. Install CocoaPods using Homebrew:
   ```bash
   brew install cocoapods
   ```
2. Initialize the pods in your project folder:
   ```bash
   pod init
   ```
3. Make sure your [`Podfile`](https://github.com/Banuba/ve-sdk-ios-integration-sample/blob/main/Example/Podfile) is set up correctly.

4. Run the following command in your terminal to install the SDK:
   ```bash
   pod install --repo-update
   ```

3. Open your project using the `.xcworkspace` file in Xcode.


### Step 4: Paste Your Token    
Open the `AppDelegate.swift` file
Replace the empty token string with your token:

```swift
// License token is required to start Video Editor SDK
  static let licenseToken: String = "YOUR_LICENSE_TOKEN"
```

### Step 5: Build and Run
Build and run your app on a simulator or device. You should see the video editor interface.
