## Welcome to Koodall’s Internal SOP Documentation

<Steps>
  <Step title="What is this Documentation?">
    - This hub provides standardized operating procedures (SOPs) for Koodall’s teams, ensuring consistency, efficiency, and compliance across departments.
    - Covering HR, Sales, Marketing, IT, and Tech Support, these SOPs streamline workflows for our fully remote workforce.
    - Use this guide to access processes like onboarding, sales demos, marketing campaigns, and IT emergency responses.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Why It Matters">
    - SOPs enhance productivity, reduce errors, and support Koodall’s mission to deliver innovative AI solutions (e.g., Amadeus, FaceAR, Glow, Together Engine) to SMEs.
    - They ensure all employees—whether in Sales, Marketing, or Tech Support—follow best practices for client engagement, infrastructure stability, and more.
    - Regular updates keep our processes aligned with Koodall’s remote-first, data-driven approach.
  </Step>

  <Step title="How to Navigate">
