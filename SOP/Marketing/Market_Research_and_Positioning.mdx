## Process Steps

    - Use HubSpot daily at 9 AM:
      - Pull CRM data (e.g., "50 leads, retail, AR interest")
      - Track behavior (e.g., "Visited /glow 3x")
      - Run "Contacts Report" (e.g., "Q1: 200 SMEs, 60% tech"), analyze preferences (e.g., "Low-cost AR"), log by 10 AM
    - Save findings in SharePoint (e.g., "Data-Q1-2025.xlsx") by Friday EOD
  </Step>

  <Step title="Industry Research">

      - "AI + [industry]" (e.g., "AI media SMEs"), filter 10-500 employees, 2 hours/week
      - Note trends (e.g., "Video editing up 30%") and SMEs (e.g., "MediaCo"), save 5-10 prospects in "My Network"
      - Summarize in HubSpot note (e.g., "Media trend: AI speed") by noon weekly
  </Step>

  <Step title="Competitor Analysis">
    - Research 3 competitors (e.g., "ARCorp") via LinkedIn/Google by Wednesday 1 PM:
      - Check strategy (e.g., "High-end AR")
