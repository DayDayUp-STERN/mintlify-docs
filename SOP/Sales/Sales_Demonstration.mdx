## Process Steps
<Steps>
  <Step title="Prepare Demo Script">
    - Use SharePoint template (e.g., "Sales/Demo-Template-2025.docx") by 2 days before demo:
      - Customize for industry (e.g., "Retail: Glow cuts AR costs by 30%")
      - Highlight AI benefits (e.g., "$500/month vs. $2k")
      - Save as "Demo-[Industry]-[Date]" (e.g., "Demo-Retail-20250305"), upload to SharePoint by EOD
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Schedule Demo">
    - Email client via Koodall Gmail (e.g., "Subject: TechShop Demo, 3/5") by 3 days prior:
      - Propose 3 times (e.g., "10 AM PST")
      - Confirm via Slack (e.g., "#sales: TechShop demo set 3/5, 10 AM") if internal coordination needed, by 2 days prior
      - Add to HubSpot calendar (e.g., "Demo-TechShop-20250305"), sync with Teams/Zoom link
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Conduct Demo">
    - Host 30-min session on Teams/Zoom at scheduled time (e.g., 10 AM PST, 3/5):
      - Demo Koodall AI (e.g., "Amadeus edits video in 5s")
      - Record feedback (e.g., "Needs faster setup") and questions (e.g., "Integration time?") live in notes
      - Log in HubSpot under contact (e.g., "TechShop, Jane Smith") by EOD, tag "Demo Done"
  </Step>
</Steps>
