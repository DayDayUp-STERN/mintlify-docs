## Process Steps
<Steps>
  <Step title="1. Industry Research">
    - Use LinkedIn daily at 9 AM:
      - Search “AI + [industry]” (e.g., “AI retail”), filter SMEs (10-500 employees)
      - Check company pages (e.g., “TechShop”) for AI pain points (e.g., “Slow video processing”)
      - Note 5-10 prospects/day, save in LinkedIn “My Network”
  </Step>

  <Step title="2. Web Search">
    - Google “AI needs [industry]” (e.g., “AI needs e-commerce”) and scan reports (e.g., Gartner) by 10 AM:
      - Identify 3-5 SMEs with AI interest (e.g., “AR for product demos”), log URLs in notes
      - Cross-check with LinkedIn findings, aim for 2 hours/week
  </Step>

  <Step title="3. Customer Classification">
    - Enter prospects in HubSpot by 11 AM:
      - Fields include industry (e.g., “Retail”), size (e.g., “50 employees”), AI need (e.g., “Fast AR”)
      - Tag as “High” (urgent need), “Medium” (exploring), “Low” (future potential), update daily
      - Assign to pipeline stage “Prospect” with notes (e.g., “TechShop: Video SDK interest”)
  </Step>

  <Step title="4. Contact Preparation">
    - Draft outreach email in Koodall email by 12 PM:
      - Use template (e.g., “Boost efficiency with Koodall AI, $500/month”)
      - Personalize with prospect data (e.g., “Saw TechShop’s AR push”), save as draft
      - Aim for 5 emails/day, reviewed by manager in HubSpot by EOD
  </Step>
</Steps>
