## Process Steps
<Steps>
  <Step title="Write Product Overview">
    - Draft 2-3 sentences on product purpose and features (e.g., "Amadeus: Video editing SDK for mobile apps"):
      - Complete within 1 day of product release, reviewed by product lead
      - Include key use case (e.g., "Real-time video filters")
  </Step>

  <Step title="List Common Issues (FAQ)">
    - Identify 5-10 frequent issues from tickets (e.g., "FaceAR: AR overlay lags") within 1 week of launch:
      - Source from Intercom logs and HubSpot trends, reviewed monthly
      - Categorize by type (e.g., integration, performance)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Detail Solutions">
    - Write step-by-step fixes (e.g., "Glow: API timeout â€“ 1. Check rate limit; 2. Adjust config; 3. Test endpoint"):
      - Limit to 3-5 steps per issue, tested by Tech Support in 2 days
      - Include fallback (e.g., "Escalate to #dev-support if unresolved")
  </Step>

  <Step title="Assign Contacts">
    - List responsible team (e.g., "Together Engine: Backend Devs") and channels (e.g., Slack `#dev-support`, `support@koodall.ai`):
      - Verify contacts with team leads quarterly, update within 1 day
      - Add escalation path (e.g., "Lead Dev: [jane@koodall.ai](mailto:jane@koodall.ai)")
  </Step>

  <Step title="Store in SharePoint">
    - Save as Word doc in SharePoint "Tech Support Knowledge Base" under product folder (e.g., "Amadeus/Manual-V1"):
      - Name file: `[Product]-Manual-[Date]-[Version]` (e.g., "FaceAR-Manual-20250225-V1")
      - Set read access for all Tech Support, upload within 3 days of completion
  </Step>
</Steps>
