## Process Steps
<Steps>
  <Step title="Receive Issue">
    - Accept customer issues via Intercom within {one} hour of submission:
      - Note initial details: customer name (e.g., "Jane Doe"), product (e.g., "Glow"), and issue (e.g., "API error")
  </Step>

  <Step title="Log Ticket">
    - Create ticket in HubSpot within thirty minutes:
      - Enter customer details, issue description, and timestamp
      - Assign unique ticket ID (e.g., "TS-20250225-001") and link to customer profile
      - Attach screenshots or logs if provided by customer
  </Step>

  <Step title="Classify and Prioritize">
    - Assess within {one} hour:
      - Technical (e.g., Together Engine bug) or Non-Technical (e.g., billing query)
      - Set priority:
        - High (e.g., system down, less than ten percent users)
        - Medium (e.g., feature issue)
        - Low (e.g., question)
      - Tag ticket in HubSpot (e.g., "Tech-High", "Non-Tech-Low")
  </Step>

  <Step title="Initial Response">
    - Reply via Intercom or email within two hours of ticket creation:
      - Include ticket ID, expected next update (e.g., "By 3 PM"), and support contact
      - Log response time in HubSpot
  </Step>

  <Step title="Resolve Issue">
    - Use product manuals (e.g., Amadeus API guide) or escalate to specialist (e.g., FaceAR lead) within four hours:
      - Test fix (e.g., "API now returns 200 OK") and confirm with customer via Intercom
      - Resolve High priority in eight hours, Medium in twenty-four hours, Low in forty-eight hours
  </Step>

  <Step title="Document Solution">
    - Save solution in SharePoint knowledge base within {one} day:
      - Use format: `[Product]-[Issue]-[Date]-[Resolution]`
      - Link ticket ID to entry for reference
  </Step>

  <Step title="Collect Feedback and Close Ticket">
    - Ask customer via Intercom for resolution rating within {one} day of fix:
      - Close ticket in HubSpot after confirmation or forty-eight hours with no reply
      - Archive closed ticket data monthly
  </Step>
</Steps>
