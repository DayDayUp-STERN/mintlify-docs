## Process Steps
<Steps>
  <Step title="Daily Monitoring">
    - IT checks AWS CloudWatch for alerts, anomalies, and resource health:
      - Review metrics like CPU usage, memory, and network traffic
  </Step>

  <Step title="Identify Issues">
    - Review security groups, tags, backups, and usage patterns for problems:
      - Examples include unauthorized access or resource overuse
  </Step>

  <Step title="Escalate if Needed">
    - Critical backend issues go to the backend team:
      - Notify via Slack `#backend-support` within 1 hour
    - Other issues are handled by IT:
      - Assign and track internally in IT system
  </Step>

  <Step title="Resolve or Mitigate">
    - Fix issues (e.g., adjust security, scale resources):
      - Document actions taken (e.g., "Scaled EC2 instance to handle load")
      - Log details in the IT incident system within 24 hours
  </Step>

  <Step title="Monthly Review">
    - Optimize costs:
      - Analyze AWS billing and adjust resources as needed
    - Update security policies:
      - Ensure compliance with standards (e.g., GDPR, SOC 2)
    - Conduct quarterly audit of AWS configuration and compliance
  </Step>
</Steps>
